    Description:
		Creates new AI groups to crew specific static weapons within an AO.
		This happens immediately after all sites have been spawned, so that
		we can have AI on the sites and ready to go before players are on
		the ground -- which is when AI will start being spawned otherwise.

		These AI units will dismounted from the static weapon when the unit
		dies, allowing paradigm managed AI to come in and mount the statics
		later.

		I've nerfed from crewing ALL static weapons to just AA statics for
		now. See how they take it.
    
    Parameter(s):
		None

    Returns:
		None
    
    Example(s):
		[] call vn_mf_fnc_sites_create_initial_static_ai_crews

in on AA/Mortars without deleting the static weapon the AI unit was
a crew member of.
