	File: fn_ctf_broadcast_notify_immediate.sqf
	Author: "DJ" Dijksterhuis

	Description:
	   Display a notification for all players via a remoteExec callback.

	   Used to perform a global notification broadcast out to all players
	   from a specific player locality.

	   player -> server -> all players

	   Means the specific player client isn't sending out remoteExec instructions to
	   all connected players, hopefully mitigating some desync/latency issues and enabling
	   use to implement a CfgRemoteExec later on.

	   TODO: Refactor this out to core/helpers?
	   TODO: Rename? Should be like fn_broadcast_global_notification.sqf

	Parameter(s):
		- _notificationClass -- class name of the notification to show [STRING]
		- _args -- arguments for string replacement in notification description text [ARRAY]

	Returns: nothing

	Example(s):
		// from player locality
		// remote execs this script on the server
		// which then remoteExecs a notification for all clients (and server, see note below)
		["FireInTheHole"] remoteExec ["vn_mf_fnc_ctf_broadcast_notify_immediate", 2];

		// from server locality
		["FireInTheHole"] call vn_mf_fnc_ctf_broadcast_notify_immediate;
