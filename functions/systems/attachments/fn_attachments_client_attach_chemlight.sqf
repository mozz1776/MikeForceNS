    Description:
        Player wants to attach a chemlight to see in the dark.

        This triggers server side execution so we can sync everything.

        Called by the "consume" system stuff, which was hacked a little to get this working.

    Parameter(s):
        TODO

    Returns: nothing

    Example(s): none
